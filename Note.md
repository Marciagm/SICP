## 1.1 Getting Started
### Shortcut

Interactive controls. Each session keeps a history of what you have typed. To access that history, press 

```
<Control>-P (previous)
<Control>-N (next)
<Control>-D exits a session
```

### Basic knowledge
* Statements & Expressions.
* Functions
* Objects
* Interpreters

*functions are objects, objects are functions, and interpreters are instances of both.*


* Errors

>Learning to interpret errors and diagnose the cause of unexpected errors is called debugging.

Tips

* Test incrementally
* Isolate errors*
* Check your assumptions
* Consult others


## 1.2 Elements of Programming
Every powerful language has three such mechanisms:

* primitive expressions and statements, which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,
* means of combination, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
* means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

ã€‹'draw'[::-1]
'ward'

The possibility of binding names to values and later retrieving those values by name means that the interpreter must maintain some sort of memory that keeps track of the names, values, and bindings. This memory is called an **environment**.

With multiple assignment, all expressions to the right of = are evaluated before any names to the left are bound to those values. As a result of this rule, swapping the values bound to two names can be performed in a single statement.

* Pure functions 
* Non pure functions

## 1.3 Defining New functions

* The user-defined function is not built into the interpreter.

* User-defined functions are used in exactly the same way as built-in functions.

**Function Signatures.** Functions differ in the number of arguments that they are allowed to take. To track these requirements, we draw each function in a way that shows the function name and its formal parameters. The user-defined function square takes only x; providing more or fewer arguments will result in an error. A description of the formal parameters of a function is called the function's signature.

The former is normal division, so that it results in a floating point, or decimal value, even if the divisor evenly divides the dividend:

5 / 4  is 1.25

8 / 4 is 2.0

The // operator, on the other hand, rounds the result down to an integer:

5//4 is 1

These two operators are shorthand for the truediv and floordiv functions.

python3 -i 1.py

doctest: 
python3 -m doctest -v 1.py
```
def square(x):
    """
    >>> square(5)
    25
    """
    return x * x

Trying:
    square(5)
Expecting:

```
def sum(a, b=10):
    return a + b

print("values: ", sum(8, 9))
print("default values: ", sum(8))
```

## 1.4 Designing Functions
* Each function should have exactly one job.
* Don't repeat yourself is a central tenet of software engineering. 
* Functions should be defined generally.

### 1.4.1 Documentation

**Comment.** in Python can be attached to the end of a line following the # symbol. These comments don't ever appear in Python's help, and they are ignored by the interpreter. They exist for humans alone.

### 1.4.2 Default Argument Values
when call a function, the number of parameters is not fixed, since there may have default argument values.

## 1.5 Control
Practical Guidance. When indenting a suite, all lines must be indented the same amount and in the same way (use spaces, not tabs). Any variation in indentation will cause an error.

Python includes several false values, including 
* 0
* None
* False
* ''

 All other numbers are true values.

 0 == -0 True

 eq(1, 1.0) True

 In operator module, 
 * ge: >= 
 * eq: ==
 

#### short-circuiting

To evaluate the expression <left> and <right>:

* Evaluate the subexpression <left>.
* If the result is a false value v, then the expression evaluates to v.
* Otherwise, the expression evaluates to the value of the subexpression <right>.

To evaluate the expression <left> or <right>:

* Evaluate the subexpression <left>.
* If the result is a true value v, then the expression evaluates to v.

* Otherwise, the expression evaluates to the value of the subexpression <right>.


To evaluate the expression not <exp>:

* Evaluate <exp>; The value is True if the result is a false value, and False otherwise.

These values, rules, and operators provide us with a way to combine the results of comparisons. Functions that perform comparisons and return boolean values typically begin with is, not followed by an underscore (e.g., isfinite, isdigit, isinstance, etc.).



A while statement that does not terminate is called an infinite loop. Press <Control>-C to force Python to stop looping.


Doctests. Python provides a convenient method for placing simple tests directly in the docstring of a function. The first line of a docstring should contain a one-line description of the function, followed by a blank line. A detailed description of arguments and behavior may follow. In addition, the docstring may include a sample interactive session that calls the function:

```
>>> def sum_naturals(n):
        """Return the sum of the first n natural numbers.

        >>> sum_naturals(10)
        55
        >>> sum_naturals(100)
        5050
        """
        total, k = 0, 1
        while k <= n:
            total, k = total + k, k + 1
        return total
```

Testing: 

* python3 -m doctest -v 1.py

## 1.6 Higher-Order-Functions
Functions that manipulate functions are called higher-order functions.

Babylonia Method

Compute a's square root: converge

(x + a/x)/2

Critically, the inner functions have access to the names in the environment where they are defined (not where they are called).

The sqrt_update function carries with it some data: the value for a referenced in the environment in which it was defined. Because they "enclose" information in this way, locally defined functions are often called closures.
